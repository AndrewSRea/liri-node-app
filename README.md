# liri-node-app

Creating a LIRI-Bot using JavaScript and node.js. LIRI-Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and 
Recognition Interface, LIRI-Bot is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI-Bot will be a command line node app that 
takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI-Bot will take your commands on the command line in Terminal (Bash) to search BandsInTown for music concerts (by typing `node liri.js 
concert-this <artist/band name>`), Spotify for songs (by typing `node liri.js spotify-this-song <song name>`, and OMDB for movies (by
typing `node liri.js movie-this <movie name>`.
